# Radix UI

Radix UI is an open-source library designed to make it easier to create accessible and customizable User Interface (UI) components in React. It provides developers with a range of `unstyled`, fully `accessible` primitives, giving them complete control over the appearance and behavior of their UI elements.

## Key Characteristics

- **`Accessibility`**: All components adhere to best practices and ARIA guidelines, ensuring accessibility for all users.
- **`Unstyled Primitives`**: Radix UI components come without predefined styles, allowing developers to fully customize their appearance.
- **`Composable API`**: The highly composable nature of these components facilitates easy integration and customization.
- **`Customization`**: Developers have complete control over the components' look and feel, enabling them to match the design language of their specific applications.

## The Components

Radix UI offers a variety of components, including:

- **`Dialog`**: A modal dialog component with focus management and keyboard accessibility.
- **`Popover`**: A floating content panel that can be anchored to a trigger element.
- **`Tooltip`**: A small informational pop-up that appears when hovering over an element.
- **`Dropdown Menu`**: A menu component with support for keyboard navigation and dynamic positioning.
- **`Tabs`**: Tabbed interface components for organizing content.
- **`Slider`**: A component that allows users to choose values within a range.
